# Maven Toys - 2024 Expansion Plans 

Maven Toys is a fictitious chain of small toy stores; they currently have 50 stores spanning 29 cities throughout Mexico. 
I was hired as a BI consultant to analyze patterns and trends in their sales and inventory data in order to create an expansion plan for 2024. And answer these 
important business questions:

Where should Maven Toys expand to?

How many stores should they open?

Which products will perform best at the new location(s)?

# Bellabeat Project 

The Google Analytics Capstone Project - Bellabeat has a variety of wellness products for women which track activity, sleep, and stress that connect to the Bellabeat app. Fitbit device data (crowd sourced from 30 eligible Fitbit users in 2016) and Google Trends search data were analyzed to help Bellabeat stakeholders gain insight into the smart device market. They also wanted to know how their products fit in and how they can gear their marketing strategy to get more sales. Data cleaning was conducted in Excel, exploration in SQL (BigQuery), visualization in Tableau and presentation in PowerPoint. 
### The PowerPoint presentation can be found [HERE](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AnML4tgV0jQmgpFWmOdudnmBaO49Ng?e=BN5egK). 
### The interactive Tableau Dashboard can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/BellabeatProject_16801054271740/Dashboard1).  

### Insights: 

- 58% of the Fitbit participants included a moderate number of steps, but only 21% reached the recommended 10,000 steps per day and the remaining 21% were sedentary taking less than 5,000 steps per day 

- The participants took the most steps on Tuesdays and Saturdays and the least on Sunday  

- The participants were mostly sedentary and with a small amount of light activity throughout the week

### Recommendations: 

- Bellabeat should promote step tracking and sleep tracking/hygiene products since those have been the more popular Google search terms in recent years 

- They could have customers set weekly activity, step and sleep goals starting on Sundays, since that's the day they take the least amount of steps, take longer to fall asleep and sleep the most 

- They could address activity levels with alerts to remind customers to get up and move when they are sedentary for a long period of time 

- They could also have competitions between app users to encourage more steps and activity

### Insights: 

- There are more than double the amount of movies vs. shows. Movies make up 70% of the content on Netflix 

- The amount of offerings declined in 2020 and 2021 (perhaps due to the pandemic restrictions) 

- 32% of the movies and tv shows are from the US and India at 11% 

- 36% of tv shows are rated Tv-Ma, for audiences over 17. But there are still a number of movies and tv shows for families and children 

- Almost 70% of the tv shows on Netflix are only 1 season long

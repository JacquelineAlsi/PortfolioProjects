#  Superstore Sales Analysis 

Exploring and visualizing Tableau sample data for a fictitious Superstore. They sell products across the United States in 3 categories (furniture, office supplies and technology) and in 3 segments (consumer, corporate and home office). The Tableau Dashboard can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/SuperstoreSales_16808929729910/Dashboard1).  

### Insights: 

- The southern region of the United States makes up the minority of sales, while the east and west make up the majority 

- The state with the most sales and profit is California with New York a close second 

- The consumer segment makes up most of the sales across the three categories 

- Office chairs, phones and office supply storage are the top 3 selling products across the three categories. But surprisingly chairs and supply storage arenâ€™t as profitable 

- The top 3 most profitable items sold are copiers, phones and accessories 

- Tables, bookcases and supplies are money losers

### Recommendations: 

- There is an opportunity for sales growth in the south and cental United States specially in the home office segment. Concentrating their marketing in these areas and to small businesses may increase the company's visibility and thus sales.  

- The 3 unprofitable items lost the company over $20,000. Perhaps they can negotiate with suppliers to lower costs so they can increase their margins on negative and low profit items.

#  Superstore Sales Analysis 

Exploring and visualizing Tableau sample data for a fictitious Superstore. They sell products across the United States in 3 categories (furniture, office supplies and technology) and in 3 segments (consumer, corporate and home office). Board members are concerned that the discount policy is being abused and would like to know if these discounts are leading to more or less profitable sales. The Tableau Dashboard can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/SuperstoreSales_16808929729910/Dashboard1).  

### Insights: 

- Discounted orders are less profitable than non-discounted orders.
- States in which discounts are greater than 20% have negative profits.

- Products in the Furniture category, namely tables and bookcases have the least amount of profit.
- This is not necessarily due to the size of the discounts since other categories have similar average discounts but have more profit.
- Office chairs, phones and office supply storage are the top 3 selling products across the three categories. But surprisingly chairs and supply storage arenâ€™t as profitable 
- The 3 most profitable items sold are copiers, phones and accessories

- Some customers are getting large discounts which are resulting in loss of profit.
- The greater the discount the less profit was made.
- Some customers received such large discounts that the profit on their sales was negative.

### Recommendations: 

- The 3 unprofitable items lost the company over $20,000. Perhaps they can negotiate with suppliers to lower costs so they can increase their margins on negative and low profit items. 
- Profits should be top of mind when giving discounts.
- More research needs to be done to find out why such large discounts were given to certian customers.

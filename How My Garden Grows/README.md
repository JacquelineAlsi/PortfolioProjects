# How My Garden Grows 

I tracked my vegetable gardening progress between April 2021 and June 2023. 
The purpose of this project was to take my garbled notes and make sense of them in order to answer a few questions: 

When should I start each plant? 

Which plants are worth growing again and which are not?   

Which sowing and growing methods do I use the most?  
So, I can stock up on materials for next year.  

Where do I need to concentrate my efforts in terms of pest control?

### Insights: 
- There is no correlation between productivity and taste. Some of the less tasty varieties are pretty productive.
- Most of the 'not productive' varieties are really tasty.
- Some of the quicker growing varieties are more expensive at the grocery store. 
- Some of the slower growing varieties are cheaper.

- Most of my plants were not affected by pests.
- I start most of my plants by directly seeding into the ground and in seed trays.
- I grow mostly in fabric grow bags and plastic pots.

### Recommendations: 
With the rising cost of food and questionable growing practices it makes sense to grow as much of my own food as possible. 
- Herbs are a must grow at $57 lb and under 60 days to harvest. 
- Carrots and squash may not be worth the time and effort, since they are relatively inexpensive and take a long time to grow.
- The productive but not so great tasting varieties aren't worth growing since I won't eat them.  
- It may be worth growing some tastier varieties in larger quantities to make up for their low productivity.
- Since direct seeding doesn't require equipment, I'll only need to stock up on seed trays.   
- I'll need to stock up on fabric grow bags and plastic pots depending on how many plants I decide to grow next year.   
- I will have to keep an eye out for white flies and aphids since they are the most prevalent of the peats in my garden.

# How My Garden Grows 

I tracked my vegetable gardening progress between April 2021 and June 2023. 
The purpose of this project was to take my garbled notes and make sense of them in order to answer a few questions: 

When should I start each plant? 

Which plants are worth growing again and which are not?   

Which sowing and growing methods do I use the most?  
So, I can stock up on materials for next year.  

Where do I need to concentrate my efforts in terms of pest control?

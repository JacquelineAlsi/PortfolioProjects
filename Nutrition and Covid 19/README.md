#  Nutrition and Covid 19

The UC Davis Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization Capstone Project - Exploring and visualizing the COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset in order to determine how nutritional choices affect Covid 19 outcomes and how healthcare providers can help guide patient's nutritional choices to achieve better outcomes if infected with covid 19. Data cleaning was conducted in Excel and exploration/visualization in Tableau.

### The Tableau Story/Dashboard can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/NutritionandCovid19/Story1)  

Two personas were created for this project: 
  - The stakeholder is a hospital administrator who is trying to come up with a plan to help reduce Covid 19 severity and negative outcomes. She will present the findings to the audience. 
  - Audience/ Subject-matter experts: The final presentation is intended for the heads of the Medical, Nursing and Dietary departments at the hospital. This will dictate what the members of each department will tell their patients when it comes to diet and Covid 19.


### Insights:
- Countries with higher Obesity Rates have overall higher death rates.

- Countries with higher Animal Products/Fats consumption have more deaths overall than countries with higher Vegetal Products/Fats consumption.
- Although Seafood is an Animal Product, lower death rates were noted in countries with the highestÂ consumption.

### Recommendations:
The medical staff should advise patients to:
  - Eat plenty of vegetables/fruits, grains, pulses and seafood. 
  - Use spices freely and often when cooking.
  - Limit animal products (except seafood), alcohol and sweetners.
  - Replace animal fats with vegetable oils.

The medical staff should also help obese patients create a plan so they can achieve a healthy weight.
### Data Limitations:
Note that these are general guidelines:
- The data groups all foods in their respective categories.
- It does not distinguish for instance between 'healthy' oils such as olive and avocado and 'inflammatory' oils such as cottonseed and partially hydrogenated oils. 
- It does not distinguish between proccessed food and food in it's whole form.
- It does not distinguish between organic, grass fed, pasture raised etc. and conventionally grown food.

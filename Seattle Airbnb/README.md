#  Seattle Airbnb Listings

Exploring and visualizing Seattle Airbnb Listing data in Tableau. Analyzing this data will help me come up with suggestions for someone wanting to become a host in the Seattle area. The potential host wants to maximize profits and be able to live in the Airbnb rental during the down season. 
### The interactive Tableau Dashboard can be found [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacqueline.alsina/viz/LisingsSeattleAirbnb/Dashboard1).  

 

### Insights: 

- Listings with more bedrooms can command a higher price per night  
- One bedroom rentals make up the majority of listings 
- Listings make the most money in the summer months and in November thru December 
- The closer you get to the Downtown Seattle area the higher the average price per listing

### Recommendations: 

- The host should look for 5 and 6 bedroom properties which would make the most amount of money.  
- The best location is close to Downtown Seattle and preferably within the 98134 zip code. The average price in this zip code is $206 per night.  
- In this zip code though, there are no 5 or 6 bedroom listings. Perhaps larger properties are not available or it would mean less competition for the host. This would require further investigation. 
- A backup location, which does have 5 and 6 bedrooms listings and an average rental price of $171 is the 98119 zip code. Just north of downtown. 
- The best time of year to rent the listing is during the summer and holiday months.
